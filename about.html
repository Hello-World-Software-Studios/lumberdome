       About Lumberdome
    </h1>
    <p>
        Lumberdome is about survival. Given a ticking clock of starvation, an axe, 
        and the meagre resources in the wilderness around you, survive as many days as you can!
        Sticks can be used to craft hunting gear, a cot, kindling, and more. Logs can be used to craft shelters like a lean-to,
        or campfire. Manage your resources wisely, and you can stave of starvation long enough to be rescued!
