       About Lumberdome
    </h1>
    <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        Lumberdome is about survival. Given a ticking clock of starvation, an axe, 
        and the meagre resources in the wilderness around you, survive as many days as you can!
        Sticks can be used to craft hunting gear, a cot, kindling, and more. Logs can be used to craft shelters like a lean-to,
        or campfire. 
        Manage your resources wisely, and you can stave of starvation long enough to be rescued!
=======
        Thunderdome Warrior is a rock-paper-scissors arena game. Choose the right tool for each fight,
        and you might win. Successive wins will net you more money to spend on better gear, and earn you a better title.
